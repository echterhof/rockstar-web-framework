# Architecture Documentation

Understanding the Rockstar Web Framework's architecture, design patterns, and internal structure.

## Contents

- [Overview](overview.md) - Overall framework design and architecture
- [Design Patterns](design-patterns.md) - Key patterns used throughout the framework
- [Extension Points](extension-points.md) - How to extend and customize the framework

## Key Concepts

The Rockstar Web Framework is built on several core architectural principles:

1. **Manager Pattern** - Services exposed through manager interfaces
2. **Context-Driven** - All services accessed through request context
3. **Interface + Implementation** - Clean separation of contracts and implementations
4. **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible through a robust plugin system
